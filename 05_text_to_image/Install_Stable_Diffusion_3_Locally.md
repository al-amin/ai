===========================================================


Overview
--------

StableSwarmUI is a modular, high-performance web-based user interface for stable diffusion models. Our focus is on making powerful tools easily accessible, with an emphasis on extensibility and ease of use.

### Prerequisites

* Ensure your brew packages are up to date with `brew update`
* Verify your brew installation with `brew doctor` and resolve any errors
