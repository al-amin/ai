**StableSwarmUI: Modular Stable Diffusion Web User Interface**
===========================================================


Overview
--------

StableSwarmUI is a modular, high-performance web-based user interface for stable diffusion models. Our focus is on making powerful tools easily accessible, with an emphasis on extensibility and ease of use.

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with StableSwarmUI, please visit our GitHub repository at [https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableSwarmUI](https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableSwarmUI).

Installing on Mac (M1 or M2 Apple Silicon Processor)
---------------------------------------------------

### Prerequisites

* Ensure your brew packages are up to date with `brew update`
* Verify your brew installation with `brew doctor` and resolve any errors
* Install .NET for macOS with `brew install dotnet`
* If you don't have Python, install it with `brew install python@3.10` and `brew install virtualenv`

### Installing StableSwarmUI

1. Open Terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to install StableSwarmUI
2. Clone the StableSwarmUI GitHub repository: `git clone https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableSwarmUI`
3. Change into the StableSwarmUI directory (`cd StableSwarmUI`)
4. Run the installation script: `./launch-macos.sh`

The installation process will begin, and you'll be prompted to download the Stable Diffusion models from the internet. This may take several minutes depending on your internet connection.

### Configuration

During the installation process, you'll be asked to choose a backend type. For Mac computers with M1 or M2 processors, we recommend choosing the ComfyUI backend and selecting the Stable Diffusion XL Base and Refiner models in the Download Models screen.
